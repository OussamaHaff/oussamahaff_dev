# Long Intro

Between excitement and fear, my feelings about the heavy adoption of GenAI tooling in our field as a hands-on software 
engineer were swinging constantly for the past year, which is the case for many of my friends and colleagues.

In many cases, the fear of something new is fueled or augmented by ignorance, so I decided mid-year 2024 to step out of 
my comfort zone being a Staff Engineer in a platform team focusing on Android -_[Avoid the frontend bias](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/uncover-the-invisible-ceiling)_- 
to invest in learning the new ecosystem of GenAI, benefiting from my academic background in CS 
where I have used both [Discriminative and Generative Models](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/generative-vs-discriminative-models) 
in computer vision (implementing those algorithms by hand using Java!) 
to build a hackathon project to have a code review assistant using LLMs, Graph RAG and LangChain,
and also on a personal level fine-tuning and even to building my own LLM!

Based on this high speed upskilling train ðŸš…, on observations I made from our industry and also based on my personal 
experience being in a Platform team for the past 3 years, I came to the following observations, analogy and conclusion.
