# Long Intro

Between excitement and fear, my feelings about the heavy adoption of GenAI in our field as a hands-on software engineer were swinging constantly for the past year which is the case of many of my friends and colleagues.

In many cases, the fear of something new is fueled or augmented by ignorance, so I decided mid-year 2024 to step out of my comfort zone (being a Staff Engineering in platform team focusing on Android - avoid the bias) and invest in learning the new ecosystem of GenAI, benefiting from my academic background in CS (Classification in Computer Vision - AKA Discriminative AI) to build a PoC of an internal code review assistant using LLMs, GraphRAG and also on a personal level fine-tuning and even to building my own LLM!

Based on this high speed upskilling train, observation in our industry and also on my personal experience being in a Platform team for the past 3 years I came to the following observations, analogy and conclusion.
