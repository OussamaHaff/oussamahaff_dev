# Long Intro

Between excitement and fear, my feelings about the heavy adoption of GenAI tooling in our field as a hands-on software 
engineer were swinging constantly for the past year, which is the case of many of my friends and colleagues.

In many cases, the fear of something new is fueled or augmented by ignorance, so I decided mid-year 2024 to step out of 
my comfort zone being a Staff Engineering in a platform team focusing on Android -_[Avoid the frontend bias](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/uncover-the-invisible-ceiling)_- 
to invest in learning the new ecosystem of GenAI, benefiting from my academic background in CS 
(Using both [Discriminative and Generative AI approaches](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/generative-vs-discriminative-models) in computer vision) 
to build a hackathon project for a code review assistant using LLMs, GraphRAG and LangChain,
and also on a personal level fine-tuning and even to building my own LLM!

Based on this high speed upskilling train, observation in our industry and also on my personal experience being in 
a Platform team for the past 3 years I came to the following observations, analogy and conclusion.
