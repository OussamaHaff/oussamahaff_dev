# Long Intro

Between excitement and fear, my feelings about the heavy adoption of GenAI tooling in our field as a hands-on software 
engineer were swinging constantly for the past year, which is the case for many of my friends and colleagues.

In many cases, the fear of something new is fueled or augmented by ignorance, so I decided mid-year 2024 to step out of 
my comfort zone being a Staff Engineer in a platform team focusing on Android -_[Avoid the frontend bias](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/uncover-the-invisible-ceiling)_- 
to invest in learning the new ecosystem of GenAI, benefiting from my academic background in CS 
where I have used both [Discriminative and Generative Models](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/generative-vs-discriminative-models) 
in computer vision (implementing those algorithms by hand using Java!) 
to build a hackathon project to have a code review assistant using LLMs, Graph RAG and LangChain,
and also on a personal level fine-tuning and even to building my own LLM!

Based on this high speed upskilling train ðŸš…, on observations I made from our industry and also based on my personal 
experience being in a Platform team for the past 3 years, I came to the following observations, analogy and conclusion.

# ICs and Farmers - An Analogy

From the previous table you can see that most of the IC tasks can be hugely assisted by ML tooling, which removes 
lots of the manual burden on engineers.

As an IC engineer who already uses this tooling in its **primitive** state currently, this led me to come to 
the conclusion that ML tooling for engineers, especially individual contributors, will have a huge impact on the role 
as a result of the change in is core tasks. IMO, what happened to modern farmers is the best example! 

Farmers initially did everything by hand (plowing, planting, harvesting) before the industrial revolution 
brought tractors and combine harvesters -sometimes even planes!- software engineers have traditionally performed 
most of the tasks manually, from writing every line of code manually (even to automate tasks), 
to debugging issues line by line, down to documenting everything by hand, before the LLM Revolution we are living currently.

Once this revolution settles down on clear winning models, and clear integrations in current IC workflows 
(Not only assisted coding, but all the tasks mentioned in the table before), I believe that the shape of the IC role
will be transformed to **_ML tooling operator_**, in the same way modern farmers found themselves 
as **_farming machines operators_**!

To explore more the aspects of this analogy, lets lay them down in 2 tables:
