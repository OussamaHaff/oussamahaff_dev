# Long Intro

Between excitement and fear, my feelings about the heavy adoption of GenAI tooling in our field as a hands-on software 
engineer were swinging constantly for the past year, which is the case for many of my friends and colleagues.

In many cases, the fear of something new is fueled or augmented by ignorance, so I decided mid-year 2024 to step out of 
my comfort zone being a Staff Engineer in a platform team focusing on Android -_[Avoid the frontend bias](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/uncover-the-invisible-ceiling)_- 
to invest in learning the new ecosystem of GenAI, benefiting from my academic background in CS 
where I have used both [Discriminative and Generative Models](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/generative-vs-discriminative-models) 
in computer vision (implementing those algorithms by hand using Java!) 
to build a hackathon project to have a code review assistant using LLMs, Graph RAG and LangChain,
and also on a personal level fine-tuning and even to building my own LLM!

Based on this high speed upskilling train ðŸš…, on observations I made from our industry and also based on my personal 
experience being in a Platform team for the past 3 years, I came to the following observations, analogy and conclusion.

# ICs and Farmers - An Analogy

From the previous table you can see that most of the IC tasks can be hugely assisted by ML tooling, which removes 
lots of the manual burden on engineers.

As an IC engineer who already uses this tooling in its **primitive** state currently, this led me to come to 
the conclusion that ML tooling for engineers, especially individual contributors, will have a huge impact on the role 
as a result of the change in is core tasks. IMO, what happened to modern farmers is the best example! 

Farmers initially did everything by hand (plowing, planting, harvesting) before the industrial revolution 
brought tractors and combine harvesters -sometimes even planes!- software engineers have traditionally performed 
most of the tasks manually, from writing every line of code manually (even to automate tasks), 
to debugging issues line by line, down to documenting everything by hand, before the LLM Revolution we are living currently.

Once this revolution settles down on clear winning models, and clear integrations in current IC workflows 
(Not only assisted coding, but all the tasks mentioned in the table before), I believe that the shape of the IC role
will be transformed to **_ML tooling operator_**, in the same way modern farmers found themselves 
as **_farming machines operators_**!

To explore more the aspects of this analogy, lets lay them down in 2 tables:


### ICs VS Farmers - Before the Revolution

# Conclusion

I think that we are in the middle of a major and a blazing fast evolution (AKA a revolution) in the software industry
after-which we will see the following:

- **Larger codebases to handle** - Just as a single farmer with modern equipment can now manage much larger farms than 
their ancestors could, software engineers using LLMs can potentially handle larger codebases and complete tasks more quickly.

- **Dependency and loss of core knowledge** - In farming, many modern farmers have become overly dependent on technology 
and in many cases lost traditional farming knowledge. When systems fail, this knowledge gap becomes critical. 
Engineers might become too dependent on LLMs for problem-solving, losing the ability to think through problems 
independently or understand fundamental principles. 

- **Rocket speed onboarding** - Learnings new tech stacks, making PoCs to explore new concepts is just way easier 
for ICs now (and also for people from outside the field) removing a big blocker in T-shaping or even pushing 
ICs to [comb-shaping](https://certibanks.com/KnowledgeArea.aspx?articleid=11).

- **Raise of the generalists** - Farmers where expected to know how to harvest some species of plants and specialise based
on their local weather, land and seeds availability, but now they are expected to be able to switch between plants
using standard seeds and tooling and also handle bigger lands. The same applies on software engineers as a result of 
the rocket speed onboarding with new tech stacks, software engineers will be expected not the stay in their speciality
and to be more of generalist.

- **Project teams will be squeezed** - As a result of raise the of the potential 
productivity gain when these tools get better, 1 or 2 engineers will be able to do a team job which will impact 
the overall size of teams across industry.

- **Titles will be flattened** - As a result of having less engineers in teams and the fact that it will be
even harder to draw a line between current IC levels junior/mid/senior/staff/principals, unless companies are willing to 
invest in the exercise of evaluation the output of their engineers bases on intuition, IMO companies will just move to
a flattened structure with fewer titles. Probably as simple as 2 levels, **_Software Engineer_** and
**_Lead Software Engineer_**.

- **Different adoption speeds** - IMO, the adoption of this evolved software engineer practice in the industry will depend 
on which **tier** (A compensation-focused classification published by
_Gergely Oroscz_ [here](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation)) 
a company is situated in:


  - Tier 3 companies would be the fastest to adopt and build their own ML tooling for ICs. 
  - Tier 1 companies could be the second and adopt more 0-code ML tools built by startups. 
  - Tier 2 companies could be the slowest to embrace this change.


## Human Brains Are Here to Stay

With all of this, one could be easily pushed to say that Software Engineers will be replaced, which is something 
I don't see coming yet based on our farmer analogy. 

Modern farmers were not 100% replaced after the industrial revolution, but their roles have evolved to be more efficient.
A side effect of that is that we have fewer farmers nowadays. I expect the same to happen for software engineers.

Software engineers who stay are the ones who manage to evolve, they wil find themselves writing lots of prompts,
reviewing tons of ML tools generated code, doing more holistic and complex system design and orchestrating the work
of AI agents.

Those new tasks depend on the understanding of outside world by reasoning and adapting to it. Which is what the human 
brain will always outpace what any ML tool/algorithm can do.


# Epilogue

In this blogpost, I didn't judge if modern farming is good, neither the evolved state of software engineering.
I didn't explore deeper drivers leading humanity to be constantly pushed to be more productive or more efficient
for profit maximisation and give opinion on them. 

Instead, I intended to make it a neutral cause-and-effect analysis. Thank you for taking the time and neurons to read it!
